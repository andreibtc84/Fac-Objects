1. # Capitalise keys
   Write a function capitaliseKeys, which takes an object as an argument, and returns a new object with the same key-value pairs except all the keys have been capitalised.
2. # String to object
   Write a function stringToObject

stringToObject takes one parameter, a string. The string is made up of key-value pairs formatted as follows: “key1:value1,key2:value2,…”

stringToObject should return an object made up of the key-value pairs in the string. Assume all values are strings.

3. # Going shopping
   Write a function shoppingList that accepts a single parameter, a string. The string is a list of ingredients, separated by a comma, formatted as below:

“2 tomatoes, 1 egg, 3 pumpkins”

The function shoppingList should return an object where the keys are the ingredient names, and the values are the number of the ingredients needed.

4. # Map Object
   Write a function mapObject that takes two parameters: an object obj and a function fn.

mapObject should return a new object whose keys are the same as those of obj, and whose values are the result of calling fn with the values of obj.
